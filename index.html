    Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar founded the Mahesh Babu Foundation in 2020 with the idea of sponsoring financial aid for children, particularly infants born with heart-related ailments. The idea stemmed from their son, Gautham, who was also born with a similar heart condition.

      Bloody Mary is one of the most popular ghosts in the world. But who was she, really? No one actually knows. There are hundreds of legends about this famous legendary character. Some say she was a widow who killed her children, while some say she was a young child who was murdered and is wandering around her grave. Other tales say the ghost is Mary Worth, a woman said to be a witch who was burned at the stake.

One legend about Bloody Mary says that if a person says "Bloody Mary" three times in front of the mirror after midnight, Mary's ghost will appear and kill them.

Some legends also portray her as a good ghost, but she is most often seen as an evil spirit
